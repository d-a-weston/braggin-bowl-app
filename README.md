# Braggin-Bowl Application
The Braggin Bowl Application

# Concept
The Braggin-Bowl is a tournament developed by me and my friends as a means of assertaining the most skilled person amongst us. The tournament is in essence, a series of smaller tournaments, each of which is a different game, sport or activity. The results from these individual tournaments are given an overall weight so that a grand champion can be named.

These activities have included such things as board games, video games, sports like Football and Rock-Climing, card games and anything else we voted on.

# The Application
This application acts as a front end to the [API](https://github.com/d-a-weston/braggin-bowl-api/) that was created with it. The application was developed in Xamarin.
